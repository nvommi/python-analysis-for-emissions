# Background
While searching for a problem to tackle, I came across the dilemma of climate change. Having taken classes on sustanability and consequences of ignoring climate change, I was interested in how transportation affected green house gas emissions and what people can do to improve this. With the changing climate, global temperatures continue to rise and the consensus among scientists is that the increasing greenhouse gas emissions have caused this. The gases trap heat on earth and are the driving factor behind increasing temperatures. This leads to melting frozen ice, causing sea levels to rise, and making hurricanes much more frequent.

# Questions
What danges does climate change pose, and can these changes be predicted? What steps can be taken to reduce the impact of climate change?

# Analysis

I imported data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the most reputable source for statistics regarding travel.  I also used data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to get specifics on the co2 emissions. Using python I was able to get a linear regression for each of the data sets. It turns out there is a much stronger correlation between personal vehicle use and co2 emissions rather than public transportation and co2 emissions.

# Conclusions
Humans have been causing climate change which causes the global sea level to rise. Areas in Baltimore are being affected and action needs to be taken soon. When considering the issue of greenhouse gas emissions specifically targeting the City of Baltimore, these results yield answers. For this city that is so dependent on travel, especially via car, by switching to public transport, the city can see several positive benefits. This data can help Baltimore local and state governments in order to divert their attention to the issues at need. By viewing this data they can understand the importance of the emissions and the proper steps to reduce them. 
# Short-Term
For the organizations and stakeholders looking into this information, there are some short and long term solutions that they can implement that have significant importance. Short-term solutions can include immediately switching to public transport today. If one individual switched to public transport for a 20 mile trip each day, over 4,627 pounds of Carbon Dioxide would be saved, amounting to a 8.1% reduction in the carbon footprint yearly. Switching to public transport is one of the most effective actions individuals can take today. At the same time it's much cheaper to take public transportation while considering the financial side of it. The American Public Transportation states that the average household would save about $10,000 a year by owning one less car and taking public transit instead. For major cities such as New York, San Francisco, and Boston, residents save on an average of $1,000 monthly. (12)  Not only does it reduce the stress of a personâ€™s commute, taking buses and trains is much cheaper than driving for not only big cities, but all across the United States. 

# Long-Term
Long-term solutions can include a long time investment into public transportation over a span of 20 years. According to a journal article conducted by the American Public Transportation Associated in 2014, capital investment in public transportation would reap strong benefits in the future. The analysis in the study indicates that over the course of 20 years if around $1 billion, nearly 15,900 jobs would be supported for a year. Combining the investment in public transportation capital and operations within the United States, per $1 billion of annual spending on public transportation an average of 21,8000 jobs would be supported for a year. The study shows that public transportation investment can have significant positive impacts on the economy. A program of enhanced investment over 20 years can have a total effect on the economy in the range of 3.7 times the amount being spent annually. 
# Implications for the Future/Practicality
To implement either of these solutions, the organization needs to keep a close track of how much individuals contribute to the carbon footprint on a yearly basis. Whether this number increases or decreases can have significant impacts on the economic outcomes. With the rise of new technologies such as hybrid cars, electric vehicles etc. the use of automobiles may become outdated. At one point, even public transport may become the leader of greenhouse gas emissions. It is important for the government to pay keen interest into the development of these technologies and their impacts. At the same time, they must investigate the feasibility of the long-term investments in the economic and political atmospheres. Currently, Baltimore has a new revised budget of $3.8 Billion for the spending board. A majority of the spending will be dedicated to parking, hotels decimated by COVID, and other recovery areas from the pandemic. It will definitely take implementation over the course of the next few years and possibly decades, but once the city recovers from the virus, the government can take steps to combat the dilemma of emissions. Baltimore can follow a plan similar to Atlanta and Pittsburgh where they have implored on Capitol Hill to invest in renewable-energy programs in order to create jobs and fund bus and rail systems. Continued discussions with the Federal Transportation Authority have allowed  over $845 million to be added to funding for transit agencies.
