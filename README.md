# python-analysis-for-emissions

# Background
While searching for a problem to tackle, I came across the dilemma of climate change. Having taken classes on sustanability and consequences of ignoring climate change, I was interested in how transportation affected green house gas emissions and what people can do to improve this. With the changing climate, global temperatures continue to rise and the consensus among scientists is that the increasing greenhouse gas emissions have caused this. The gases trap heat on earth and are the driving factor behind increasing temperatures. This leads to melting frozen ice, causing sea levels to rise, and making hurricanes much more frequent.

# Questions
What danges does climate change pose, and can these changes be predicted? What steps can be taken to reduce the impact of climate change?

# Analysis
I imported data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the most reputable source for statistics regarding travel.  I also used data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to get specifics on the co2 emissions. Using python I was able to get a linear regression for each of the data sets. It turns out there is a much stronger correlation between personal vehicle use and co2 emissions rather than public transportation and co2 emissions.
